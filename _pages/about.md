I am a landscape ecologist who measures ecosystem services and environmental change across space and time. I have a particular interest in working lands, where society and nature overlap. I combine machine learning, multi-sensor remote sensing, and causal inference to build geospatial AI systems that turn large environmental datasets into decision-ready insights for sustainability.

I am currently a PhD candidate at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, advised by Ashley Larsen, Robert Heilmayr, Kathy Baylis, and Lola Fatoyinbo. In April 2026, I will begin a postdoctoral appointment at the Environmental Data Science Innovation & Impacts Lab (ESIIL) at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

My research has been supported by fellowships and grants from NASA, USDA, and the Schmidt Foundation.

When I'm not thinking about forests and farms, you can find me enjoying the outdoors with my wife and our amazing daughter June.


My Research
======
My work focuses on building and validating models that map, monitor, and attribute ecological change—with an emphasis on outcomes that matter for management and policy (e.g., carbon stocks and fluxes, productivity, habitat dynamics, and pest-control services).

Geospatial ML at scale: Train and evaluate models that integrate heterogeneous spatial data to produce reliable landscape-level predictions and uncertainty.

Multi-sensor remote sensing fusion: Combine optical, SAR, and LiDAR to improve estimates of ecosystem structure and function (e.g., biomass, primary productivity).

Biodiversity + ecosystem services: Use ground-based sensing (including NEXRAD weather radar) to quantify animal activity (e.g., bats/avian movement) and connect it to human-relevant outcomes.

What it enables
These tools help stakeholders move from “what happened?” to “where, how much, why, and what next?”—supporting more effective monitoring, climate mitigation planning, and resource management.

Outside of research, I contribute to open science by developing tools like BATS (Bat-Aggregated Time Series) and I’m committed to inclusive environmental education and responsible AI applications.
