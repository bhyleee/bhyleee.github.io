My name is Brian Lee and I am a landscape ecologist exploring the interactions between managed lands and the surrounding environment. I do this using a combination of remote sensing fusion, machine learning, and causal inference approaches.

My Research
======
We live in an era of unprecedented environmental data collection—on the ground, from the air, and from space. My research harnesses machine learning and multi-sensor remote sensing to transform these vast datasets into actionable insights that help us better understand biodiversity, ecosystems, and agriculture.

I develop AI-driven models to quantify ecological processes across landscapes, integrating diverse datasets to examine interactions between managed and natural lands. My work bridges computational advances with real-world sustainability challenges across spatial and temporal scales. I use spaceborne sensors—including optical, SAR, and LiDAR—to characterize ecosystem attributes like biomass and primary productivity, while leveraging ground-based sensors, such as NEXRAD weather radar, to track bats and other avifauna. By bringing these approaches together, I explore how species interact with landscapes and how human activities both benefit from and reshape ecological systems.

Beyond research, I am committed to open science and inclusivity. I design tools like BATS (Bat-Aggregated Time Series) to make complex environmental monitoring more accessible, lead environmental education programs for underrepresented students, and advocate for AI applications that inform equitable climate solutions. Looking ahead, my goal is to expand interdisciplinary collaborations that fuse geospatial AI, climate science, and ecological modeling to address pressing environmental challenges at local and global scales.
